# SQL_Projects

## Premise

In this project, my role is co-owner of a DVD rental store, which I purchased with my rich Uncle Jimmy.

As a new owner, I need to learn everything about the business, including the product inventory, staff, and customer demographics. Since the current employees of the store are not able to provide much help, I need to access the Maven Movies SQL database and learn everything I can, on my own.

The project is divided into two parts:

Answer questions from the insurance company.
Answer questions from a new business prospect.


While doing a cursory review of the data, we see that the Maven Movies database contains 16 related tables, consisting of information on the company’s customers, business, and inventory.

### Project Part 1- scenario

The company’s insurance policy is up for renewal and the insurance company’s underwriters need some updated information from us before they will issue a new policy.


The Business Questions
We will need a list of all staff members, including their first and last names, email addresses, and the store identification number where they work.
We will need separate counts of inventory items held at each of your two stores.
We will need a count of active customers for each of your stores. Separately, please.
In order to assess the liability of a data breach, we will need you to provide a count of all customer email addresses stored in the database.
We are interested in how diverse your film offering is as a means of understanding how likely you are to keep customers engaged in the future. Please provide a count of unique film titles you have in inventory at each store and then provide a count of the unique categories of films you provide.
We would like to understand the replacement cost of your films. Please provide the replacement cost for the film that is least expensive to replace, the most expensive to replace, and the average of all films you carry.
We are interested in having you put payment monitoring systems and maximum payment processing restrictions in place in order to minimize the future risk of fraud by your staff. Please provide the average payment you process, as well as the maximum payment you have processed.
We would like to better understand what your customer base looks like. Please provide a list of all customer identification values, with a count of rentals they have made all time, with your highest volume customers at the top of the list.
