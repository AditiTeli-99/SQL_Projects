# SQL_Projects

## Premise

In this project, my role is co-owner of a DVD rental store, which I purchased with my rich Uncle Jimmy.

As a new owner, I need to learn everything about the business, including the product inventory, staff, and customer demographics. Since the current employees of the store are not able to provide much help, I need to access the Maven Movies SQL database and learn everything I can, on my own.

The project is divided into two parts:

Answer questions from the insurance company.
Answer questions from a new business prospect.


While doing a cursory review of the data, we see that the Maven Movies database contains 16 related tables, consisting of information on the company’s customers, business, and inventory.

### Project Part 1- scenario

The company’s insurance policy is up for renewal and the insurance company’s underwriters need some updated information from us before they will issue a new policy. Note:- The details of all the request from client and the queries are given in the presentation


### Project Part 2- scenario
You and your business partner were recently approached by another local business owner who is interested in purchasing Maven Movies. He primarily owns restaurants and bars, so he has lots of questions for you about your business and the rental business in general. His offer seems very generous, so you are going to entertain his questions. 
Note:- Check the presentation for qll the request and sql queries
